# 🌌 ExoPlanet

**ExoPlanet** is a 2D space strategy prototype inspired by games like *Alien Tribe 2* and *Master of Orion*. Built in Unity, this project focuses on a clean and incremental development cycle with minimal fluff — prioritizing gameplay mechanics over visuals.

## 🎮 Current Features
- Procedural galaxy generation
- Clickable stars with unique IDs
- Scene transitions between Galaxy and individual Star Systems
- Planets generated per system with circular placement
- Planet click interaction and dynamic logging

## 🚀 Development Goals
- Expand to include colonization logic
- Implement a tick-based resource system
- Build a UI for planet and system management
- Optimize for mobile deployment (iOS + Android)
- Support save/load game functionality

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Unity 6.x (2D Core)
- C#
- Git/GitHub for version control

## 📦 Repo Structure
- `/Assets`: Unity project source (scripts, scenes, prefabs)
- `/DevLogs`: George AI development logs and task tracking (local only)

## 💡 Notes
This repo intentionally excludes build artifacts (e.g., `.app`, `.exe`) to keep Git clean and lightweight. Use `.gitignore` to manage Unity-generated folders like `/Library`, `/Builds`, and `/Temp`.
